# Conversion Notes — v1

## Converted from prototype to PHP/MySQL

- Removed hardcoded `JOBS`, `APPS`, `USERS`, `CLIENTS` and stage counts as the production data source.
- Public Careers pages now read published jobs from MySQL.
- Application submission now creates Applicant + Application records and stage history.
- Resume uploads are validated and stored with randomized filenames.
- Application tracking validates both reference number and applicant email.
- HR portal now uses real database counts, applicants, stages, interviews and manpower requests.
- Client portal is restricted to the signed-in client's formally endorsed candidates.
- HR endorsement creates an endorsement record and moves the candidate to Client Review.
- Client approval moves a candidate to Offer; decline returns the candidate to HR.
- Offer, deployment scheduling, deployment completion and manpower fill count are database-backed.
- Authentication now uses MySQL users, PHP sessions and `password_hash()`.
- Write actions use CSRF protection and audit logging.
- Existing UI styling from the supplied prototype is retained in `public/assets/app.css`.

## Deliberately not merged

The supplied `pmbsi-hrsd-handover.zip` is an HR Service Desk/ticketing backend, not a Recruitment backend. It is treated as a reference for future shared HRIS concepts only. Ticket tables were not reused as applicant/application records.
